[GitHub - morganw-code/morgan-webb-portfolio: My personal portfolio](https://github.com/morganw-code/morgan-webb-portfolio)

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to create a personal portfolio that can be accessed easily by anyone who wishes to learn more about myself or the work I envolve myself in. Some of the things you will find on the website about me are my interests, hobbies, blog posts, twitter feed, work history, and more. 

## Functionality / Features

`index.html` is the main page and it contains my twitter feed, a range of small blog posts, and a couple pictures that I feel describe me the best.

`projects.html` is a page to showcase my past and current projects along with an animated gif of each showcase and a button to easily navigate to the corresponding reposity, should anyone wish to do so.

`about.html` is a page that lists things such as my interests, my hobbies, my education and work history, as well as a photo of me, and a download button for my resume.

`contact.html` is a page that lists my personal contact email and my twitter handle.

#### Consistent Style

Webpages across my portfolio website use consistent styling like the navbar, footer, etc, and there are different styles for different branches of my portfolio, with each version having its own theme.

#### Scripted Header Bar

I utilise JavaScript to create a little ghost-typing gimmick that displays a different message depending on what page the user is currently on. Originally the keystroke delay was picked at random (within a range, per character) to give the ghost-typing script a little human-like vibe, but it has since been changed to type out messages more quickly.

#### Responsiveness

My portfolio should display decently across all modern devices. My portfolio utilises things like flexbox, wrapping, etc to give the layout more flexibility regardless of screen size.

#### Different Versions / Branches

My portfolio has three different themes:
 - Normal (master)
 - Dark (dark)
 - Light (light)
 
#### Subresource Integrity

My portfolio website checks the SHA integrity of all externally linked resources before they're loaded to ensure that each resource is safe to help mitigate any security issues.
