[GitHub - morganw-code/morgan-webb-portfolio: My personal portfolio](https://github.com/morganw-code/morgan-webb-portfolio)

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to create a personal portfolio that can be accessed easily by anyone who wishes to learn more about myself or the work I envolve myself in. Some of the things you will find on the website about me are my interests, hobbies, blog posts, twitter feed, work history, and more. 

## Functionality / Features

`index.html` is the main page and it contains my twitter feed, a range of small blog posts, and a couple pictures that I feel describe me the best.

`projects.html` is a page to showcase my past and current projects along with an animated gif of each showcase and a button to easily navigate to the corresponding reposity, should anyone wish to do so.

`about.html` is a page that lists things such as my interests, my hobbies, my education and work history, as well as a photo of me, and a download button for my resume.

`contact.html` is a page that lists my personal contact email and my twitter handle.

#### Consistent Style

Webpages across my portfolio website use consistent styling. There are different styles for different branches of my portfolio with each version having its own theme.

#### Scripted Header Bar

I utilise JavaScript to create a little ghost-typing gimmick that displays a different message depending on what page the user is currently on. Originally the keystroke delay was picked at random (within a range, per character) to give the ghost-typing script a little human-like vibe, but it has since been changed to type out messages more quickly.

#### Responsiveness

My portfolio should display decently across all modern devices. My portfolio utilises things like flexbox to give the layout more flexibility.

#### Different Versions / Branches

My portfolio has three different themes:
 - Normal (master)
 - Dark (dark)
 - Light (light)
 
#### Subresource Integrity

My portfolio website checks the RSA integrity of all externally linked resources before they're loaded to ensure that each resource is safe to help mitigate any security issues.
